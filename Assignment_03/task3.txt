Task 3

a) What is the size of variable p on Euler?
Command: print sizeof(p)
8 Bytes

b) What is the address of p?
Command: print &p
(int **) 0x7fffffffdda8

c) What is the address of c?
Command: print &c
0x7fffffffdda7 ""

d) What is the value of arr[0] after the assignment on line 16?
Command: next
Command: print arr[0]
4195616

e) What is the value of arr[0] at the end of the program?
Command: next
Command: print arr[0]
266

f) Explain why the value of arr[0] changes.
with casting the int pointer p to a char pointer and accessing the next element in the assumed array in the memory is accessed which is arr. This way arr[0] gets assigned to (char)1
