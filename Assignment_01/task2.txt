# Assignment 01, Task 2
a) What directory/folder do you start in when you log in to Euler? Give the full path to the directory.

To check in which directory you are currently working the commando "pwd" or "print working directory" should be used. The directory that you start in when logging into Euler is the users Home Directory. In my specific case it was /srv/home/gbettenhausen.



b) What shell is running when you log in? (Use this resource: https://www.learnshell.org/)

Checking which shell you are using can be done through the "ps" or "print shell". When logging in the shell that is running is BASH or the "Bourne Again Shell"

c) Identify two flags (other than -l, -r, -t) that can be passed to the ls command. Explain what the flags do.

-a : Also return files starting with '.'
-d : List the names of the directories along with the other files rather than their content

d) How many lines of text are in the file /proc/cpuinfo?
There are 2101 lines in /proc/cpuinfo, read by unsing 'info cpuinfo'.
To get there, use 'cd ..' until the highest level is reached and then access /proc

e) Using the module command, determine the highest available version of GCC on Euler.
// no solution found yet; 'module whatis gcc' does not return an answer
