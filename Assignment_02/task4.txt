The difference in including files through <...> and "..." is that <...> is used for including header files that are located in the standard library folders on your Computer, whereas "..." is used for including header files that are located in the same directory as the program you wish to compile. So in essence one should use <...> for including header files of outside libraries one wishes to use and "..." for headers and libraries that are user defined. It is also important to note that <...> will only look for files in the standard pre-defined search directories, while "..." will only look in your compiling directory.
